# Experiment tracking example
This example will show you how to track your experiments using Sacred, how to perform hyperparameter search and how to perform the experiments in a distributed manner on our Slurm cluster.


## MongoDB configuration
Before starting, please make sure you have your MongoDB credentials stored in `$HOME/.config/seml/mongodb.config`. The easiest way to do so is to run `seml configure`, which will store your credentials in the correct format in the right place.


## Experiment configuration

In `example_config.yaml` we define the parameter configurations that will be run.

There are two special blocks for meta-configuration: `seml` and `slurm`.

### `seml` block
The `seml` block is required for every experiment. It has to contain the following values:
   - `executable`: Name of the Python script containing the experiment
Optionally, it can contain
   - `conda_environment`: Name of the Anaconda virtual environment; will be loaded before the experiment is executed.
   - `output_dir`: Directory to store log files in. Default: Current directory
   - `project_root_dir`: (Relative or absolute) path to the root of the project. seml will then upload all the source
                         files imported by the experiment to the MongoDB. Moreover, the uploaded source files will be
                         downloaded before starting an experiment, so any changes to the source files in the project
                         between queueing and starting the experiment will have no effect.
### `slurm` block
The special 'slurm' block contains the slurm parameters. This block and all values are optional. Possible values are:
   - `name`: Job name used by Slurm and file name of Slurm output. Default: Collection name
   - `experiments_per_job`: Number of parallel experiments to run in each Slurm job. Note that only experiments from the same batch share a job. Default: 1
   - `max_jobs_per_batch`: Maximum number of Slurm jobs running per experiment batch. Default: No restriction
   - `sbatch_options`: dictionary that contains custom values that will be passed to `sbatch`, specifying e.g. the
                       memory and the number of GPUs to be allocated. See [here](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html)
                       for possible parameters of `sbatch` (prepended dashes are not required).

### Parameter blocks
In the `small_datasets` and `large_datasets` (names are of course only examples; you can name sub-configs as you like) we have specified different sets of parameters to try.
They will be combined with the parameters in `grid` in the root of the document.

If a specific configuration (e.g. `large_datasets`) defines the same parameters, they will override the ones defined in the root, e.g. the learning rate in the example above.
This means that for all configurations in the `large_datasets` the learning rate will be `0.001` and not `0.01` or `0.05` as defined in the root of the document.

This can be nested arbitrarily deeply (be aware of combinatorial explosion of the parameter space, though!)

### Grid parameters
In an experiment config, under `grid` you can define parameters that should be sampled from a regular grid. Currently supported
are:
   - `choice`: List the different values you want to evaluate under `options`.
   - `range`: Specify the `min`, `max`, and `step`. Parameter values will be generated using `np.arange(min, max, step)`.
   - `uniform`: Specify the `min`, `max`, and `num`. Parameter values will be generated using
                `np.linspace(min, max, num, endpoint=True)`
   - `loguniform`: Specify `min`, `max`, and `num`. Parameter values will be uniformly generated in log space (base 10).

### Random parameters
Under 'random' you can specify parameters for which you want to try several random values. Specify the number
of samples per parameter with the `samples` value and optionally the random seed with `seed` as in the examples below. Supported parameter types are:
  - `choice`: Randomly samples `<samples>` entries (with replacement) from the list in `options`
  - `uniform`: Uniformly samples between `min` and `max` as specified in the parameter dict.
  - `loguniform`:  Uniformly samples in log space between `min` and `max` as specified in the parameter dict.
  - `randint`: Randomly samples integers between `min` (included) and `max` (excluded).

## Add experiments to queue

To insert the experiments the queue in the database, open a terminal on a machine with access to the `Slurm` system. In this directory and run

```
seml example_config.yaml queue
```

If you open your MongoDB (e.g. with the software `robo3t`), you should now find a collection `seml_example` with the queued experiments.
Note that the config file is specified _before_ the operation (`queue`).

To see what the option `--force-duplicates` does, run the above command again. The output should now read something like:

```
72 of 72 experiments were already found in the database. They were not added again.
```

That is, the script checks whether experiments with the same configuration are already in the database collection.
In this case, they are not added to the queue to avoid redundant computations. In order to force add duplicates to the database, use the `--force-duplicates` argument.

All experiments are now already in the database collection specified in `example_config.yaml` and in the QUEUED state.

## Run experiments using Slurm
To run the queued experiments on the Slurm cluster, run:
```bash
seml example_config.yaml start
```
The config file is only needed to specify the MongoDB collection. All other parameters will be loaded from the MongoDB.

### Running multiple experiments per Slurm job
Often, a single experiment requires much less GPU RAM than is available on a GPU. Thus, we can
often run multiple experiments per Slurm job (which commonly uses a single GPU) to increase the throughput of our experiments.
This can be done by setting the `experiments_per_job` argument in the `slurm` block of the config file.

Note that this will only run your own experiments in parallel on a GPU. It will never run
your experiments on a GPU that is reserved by another user's job.
Furthermore, only experiments from the same batch share jobs.

## Check the status of your Slurm jobs

You can check the status of your Slurm jobs by running `squeue` or `seml example_config.yaml status`
in the terminal. To check the console output of a experiment, open the corresponding logfile, e.g. `cat slurm-564.out`.

To check whether some experiments may have failed due to errors, you can run:
```bash
seml example_config.yaml status
```

You can cancel (interrupt) all pending and running experiments with
```bash
seml example_config.yaml cancel
```

You can reset all failed, killed, or interrupted experiments to QUEUED with
```bash
seml example_config.yaml reset
```

You can delete all queued, failed, killed, or interrupted experiments with
```bash
seml example_config.yaml delete
```

These three commands also support passing a specific Sacred ID and a custom list of states.

Moreover, you can specifically cancel/reset/delete experiments that match a custom dictionary, e.g.
```bash
seml example_config.yaml cancel --filter-dict '{"config.dataset":"cora_ml", "config.hidden_sizes": [16]}'
```

Finally, you can manually detect experiments whose corresponding Slurm jobs were killed unexpectedly with
```bash
seml example_config.yaml detect-killed
```
(Detection is run automatically when executing the `status`, `delete`, `reset`, and `cancel` commands and therefore rarely necessary to do manually.)

### Batches
`seml` assigns each experiment a batch ID, where all experiments that were queued together get the same batch ID. 
You can use this to cancel all the experiments from the last configuration that you've started, e.g. if you find a bug. 
Use
```bash
seml example_config.yaml cancel --batch-id i
```
or equivalently
 ```bash
seml example_config.yaml cancel --filter-dict '{"batch_id": i}'
```
to cancel all jobs from batch `i`.

## Retrieve and evaluate results
See the [example notebook](notebooks/experiment_results.ipynb) for an example of how to retrieve and evaluate our toy experiment's results.
